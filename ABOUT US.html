            <u>ABOUT APYouthS</u> 
        </h1>
        Asia-Pacific Youth Service (AP-YouthS) is the biggest social media start-up to perform youth community engagement in the Asia Pacific. In the beginning, the idea of this start-up was to share opportunities for youth-based programs and provide a place where young people within their community and organization can easily promote their project or program.
        <br>Since 2015, our social media has developed significantly in term of engagement and scope reach. Also, now we have more than 110.000+ followers from all over Asia and the Pacific region within all our social media platforms including Instagram, Line, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn.
        <br>This achievement shows that AP-YouthS is very influential among the youth. After four years of working, strengthening, and building the community, AP-YouthS come up with new ideas and programs.
        <br>Now AP-YouthS thinks about social enterprise with the intention to utilize more impact and the strong power of social media to engage more young people. We have developed our program named ‘AP-YouthS Empowerment’
        <br>which focuses on Student Mobility, Youth Entrepreneurship, and Youth Empowerment (consisting of projects towards Youth with Disabilities, Youth Affected by Disaster, and Youth Living in Slum Areas).

We give free service for student to promote their programs, we welcome youth business’ to get featured in our social media, and we are open for paid promotions where the income of the program will be distributed towards the training and mentorship services for Youth with Disabilities, Youth Affected by Disaster, and Youth Living in Slum Areas.

Since global society puts high attention to young people especially towards the success of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets in solving various problems, AP-YouthS is committed to work with the youth and uphold the concept of no young person left behind to make sure our sustainability and the future work in their best rhythm.
